# E-Commerce-Database-Management-and-Analysis

This is an SQL Project for E-Commerce Database Management and Analysis. The project involves designing a relational database for an e-commerce platform, performing data manipulations, and extracting meaningful insights using SQL queries. The task is to design, implement, and query an SQL database for an e-commerce platform.

## Schema Design Analysis

![Schema](screenshots/er_diagram.png)

The schema represents a relational database designed for managing e-commerce transactions. It emphasizes clarity, normalization, and efficient data retrieval, supporting operations related to orders, customers, products, and their relationships. Below is an overview and detailed breakdown of the schema's design principles and components optimised for transactional workflows.

---

### 1. Key Entities and Relationships

1. **Customers:**
   - The `customers` table captures essential user information, including:
     - **Unique identifier** (`customer_id`): Ensures distinct identification of each customer.
     - **Attributes**: Name, email, phone number, and address for customer communication and record-keeping.
   - **Primary Purpose**: Acts as the core entity for user data, linking directly to orders.

2. **Orders:**
   - The `orders` table contains transaction-specific data:
     - **Unique identifier** (`order_id`): Distinct key for each order.
     - **Foreign Key** (`customer_id`): Establishes the relationship between orders and their respective customers.
     - **Attributes**: `order_date` and `total_amount` for operational and analytical purposes.
   - **Primary Purpose**: Central entity for managing transactional workflows.

3. **Order_Items:**
   - The `order_items` table provides a many-to-one mapping between orders and products:
     - **Composite Foreign Keys**: Links to `orders` (`order_id`) and `products` (`product_id`).
     - **Attributes**: Includes quantity and price to track revenue details.
   - **Primary Purpose**: Supports detailed order line items for each transaction.

4. **Products:**
   - The `products` table catalogs all available inventory:
     - **Unique identifier** (`product_id`): Primary key for each product.
     - **Attributes**: Includes `product_name`, `category`, `price`, and `stock_quantity`.
   - **Primary Purpose**: Serves as a reference entity for managing product details.

---

### 2. Design Principles

1. **Normalization:**
   - The schema adheres to **third normal form (3NF)**, ensuring minimal redundancy:
     - Customer and product details are stored in separate tables and referenced via foreign keys.
     - Transactional details are isolated in `orders` and `order_items`, enabling granular tracking.

2. **Referential Integrity:**
   - All relationships are enforced through **foreign key constraints**, ensuring data consistency:
     - Orders are linked to valid customers via `customer_id`.
     - Each product in an order is referenced accurately through `product_id`.

3. **Scalability:**
   - The schema design supports horizontal scalability:
     - Additional product attributes (e.g., descriptions, supplier data) can be easily added.
     - High-frequency operations (e.g., fetching a customer's order history) are optimized through clear relationships.

4. **Operational Efficiency:**
   - The schema design supports:
     - **Efficient query execution**: Indexed fields such as `customer_id`, `order_id`, and `product_id` ensure fast lookups.
     - **Aggregate operations**: Simplifies analysis, such as total revenue by customer or product.

---

### 3. Use Case Application

1. **E-Commerce Operations:**
   - Manage customer orders and track product inventory efficiently.
   - Support detailed insights into customer spending patterns and product sales performance.

---

### 4. Recommendations for Enhancement

1. **Indexing Strategy:**
   - Create indexes on frequently queried fields such as `customer_id`, `order_id`, and `product_id` to optimize performance for analytical queries.

## Queries

### Retrieve All Orders Made by a Specific Customer

This query will return all the orders placed by Emma Wilson (Customer ID 5), including the order_id, order_date, and total_amount.

```sql
SELECT o.order_id, o.order_date, o.total_amount 
FROM Orders o
JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
WHERE c.customer_id = 5;
```

|order_id|order_date|total_amount|
|--------|----------|------------|
|7|2024-01-30 09:05:00.000|359.97|
|30|2024-05-12 16:50:00.000|359.97|
|50|2024-09-18 11:20:00.000|359.97|
|70|2024-12-23 11:30:00.000|359.97|

### Revenue Analysis

- Calculate the total revenue generated by the e-commerce platform

This query calculates the total revenue by summing up the product of the price and quantity columns from the Order_Items table.

```sql
SELECT SUM(price * quantity) AS total_revenue
FROM Order_Items;
```

|total_revenue|
|-------------|
|17449.01|

- Find the revenue generated per product

This query joins the Order_Items and Products tables to retrieve product names, groups the data by `product_id` and `product_name`,
calculates the total revenue for each product by summing `price * quantity`, and orders the results in descending order to highlight the most profitable products.

```sql
SELECT 
    p.product_id,
    p.product_name,
    SUM(oi.price * oi.quantity) AS revenue
FROM Order_Items oi
JOIN Products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_id, p.product_name
ORDER BY revenue DESC;
```

|product_id|product_name|revenue|
|----------|------------|-------|
|1|Laptop|5799.94|
|4|Smartphone|4149.94|
|6|Gaming Chair|1099.92|
|18|Washing Machine|799.99|
|9|Smartwatch|739.93|
|3|Coffee Maker|559.93|
|7|Bluetooth Speaker|549.94|
|10|Keyboard|539.94|
|2|Headphones|449.91|
|11|Electric Kettle|399.96|
|19|Printer|359.96|
|16|Shredder|339.96|
|5|Wireless Mouse|339.87|
|8|Air Purifier|299.97|
|13|Tablet|279.97|
|17|Vitamins|239.96|
|15|Electric Toothbrush|219.96|
|14|Office Chair|169.99|
|12|Desk Lamp|109.97|

    c.email,
    SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spending
FROM Customers c
JOIN Orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name, c.email
ORDER BY total_spending DESC
LIMIT 5;
```
